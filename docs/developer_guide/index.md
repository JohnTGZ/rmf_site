## Developer Guide

This guide is currently work in progress. The goal is to document the internals of site editor. In particular, how various parts work.
For starters we have documented design decisions around `Undo` and `Deletion`. The hope is that as we add more features, people keep adding to this guide so that new contributors find it easy to work with the codebase.

### Topics

* [Building from source](building.md)
* [Implementing Undo in your plugin](undo.md)
